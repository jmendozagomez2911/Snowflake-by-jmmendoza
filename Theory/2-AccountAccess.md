# Section 3: Account Access & Security

This section covers **20-25%** of the SnowPro Core Certification exam and focuses on *who* can do *what* in Snowflake, *how* they authenticate, and *how* data is protected. Key themes include:

- **Access Control** (RBAC, DAC)
- **Roles & Privileges**
- **User Authentication** (passwords, MFA, federated auth, etc.)
- **Network Policies**
- **Data Encryption**
- **Column & Row-Level Security**
- **Secure Views**
- **Account Usage & the Information Schema**

---

## 1. Introduction to Account Access & Security

Snowflake‚Äôs security model combines:
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ‚Äì Privileges (SELECT, CREATE, etc.) are assigned to roles rather than directly to users. Users get permissions by having roles granted to them.
2. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** ‚Äì Every object (table, view, etc.) has an *owner* (the role that created it). That owner can grant or revoke privileges on the object to other roles.

Exam-wise, you‚Äôll see many questions about creating/managing roles, understanding ownership, granting/revoking privileges, using multi-factor authentication, controlling network access, and so forth.

---

## 2. Access Control Overview

- **Scope**: Defines *who* can perform *what operations* on *which objects*.
- **Two Major Schemes**
    1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
        - Privileges are assigned to *roles*.
        - Roles are then granted to *users*.
        - A user can have multiple roles and can switch the *active* role in a session.
    2. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**:
        - Each object in Snowflake has exactly one *owner role*.
        - The owner can grant/revoke privileges on that object to other roles.

- **Object Hierarchy & Ownership**
    - Securable objects include databases, warehouses, schemas, tables, stages, etc.
    - The role that creates an object is its owner and has *all privileges* on that object.
    - Owners can transfer ownership to another role or manage privileges with `GRANT` / `REVOKE`.
    - A global privilege called **MANAGE GRANTS** also lets a role grant/revoke privileges on objects it does *not* own.

---

### üß† Account vs User

To clarify Snowflake's structure:

- An **account** is a complete Snowflake environment ‚Äî it contains its own warehouses, databases, roles, and users. Each organization may have multiple accounts (e.g. dev, test, prod).
- A **user** is an identity that connects to a specific account. Users exist **inside an account**, and each account manages its own user list.

You filter by `user_name` in views like `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` to see what each individual user did **within that account**. You are not querying users from other accounts ‚Äî only from the one you're logged into.

Example:
```sql
SELECT user_name, query_text, execution_status
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(DAY, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
```


## 3. Roles

- **Definition**: A *role* is a *securable object* that can hold privileges on other objects. Roles can also be granted to other roles, forming a hierarchy.

  - **System-Defined Roles**
      1. **ORGADMIN**: Top-level *organization* role (manages multiple Snowflake accounts, usage across org, etc.).
      2. **ACCOUNTADMIN**: Top-level *account* role; can do nearly everything in the account (billing, all object access).
      3. **SECURITYADMIN**: Manages **access control and privileges** across the account. Can create, alter, and drop both **users and roles**, and **grant or revoke roles and object-level privileges**. Also responsible for managing **role hierarchies**, RBAC enforcement, and **enterprise-level security policies**.  
         ‚Üí Use this role when enforcing security, assigning roles to other roles, or managing access to objects like tables, warehouses, and databases.
      4. **USERADMIN**: Manages **user accounts** and **custom roles**. Can create, alter, and drop users, reset passwords, assign default roles and warehouses (only within its role hierarchy), and manage login policies.  
       ‚Üí Use this role for onboarding users, managing identity, and setting up default access, but **not** for granting access to objects or managing roles outside its scope.
      5. **SYSADMIN**: Manages *objects* (warehouses, databases, schemas, etc.).
      6. **PUBLIC**: A pseudo-role granted to *all* users by default (objects owned by PUBLIC are open to everyone).

      ### USERADMIN vs SECURITYADMIN
    
        | Feature / Capability                              | `USERADMIN`          | `SECURITYADMIN`        |
        |---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
        | Create/Alter/Drop Users                           | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes                |
        | Create/Alter/Drop Roles                           | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes                |
        | Assign Roles to Users                             | ‚úÖ (limited scope)   | ‚úÖ (full scope)       |
        | Grant/Revoke Privileges on Objects                | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes                |
        | Manage Role Hierarchy (grant role to role)        | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes                |
        | Manage Login Policies / Password Resets           | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes                |
        | Used for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)         | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes


- **Custom Roles**
    - Created to implement the principle of *least privilege*.
    - Typically aligned with business roles, e.g., `DATA_ANALYST`, `ETL_ENGINEER`, etc.
    - Created by roles that have the `CREATE ROLE` privilege, such as `USERADMIN`, `SECURITYADMIN`, or `ACCOUNTADMIN`.
    - However, **creating a custom role is not the same as assigning it**:
        - `USERADMIN` can create and assign roles, but **only within its own hierarchy**.
        - To assign a custom role to a **system-defined role** (e.g., `SYSADMIN`) or across role trees, a higher-level role such as `SECURITYADMIN` is required.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      CREATE ROLE data_engineer;
      GRANT ROLE data_engineer TO ROLE sysadmin; -- requires SECURITYADMIN
      ```
    - This separation ensures that role delegation respects Snowflake‚Äôs role hierarchy and prevents unauthorized privilege elevation.

- **Role Hierarchy**
    - If Role A is granted to Role B, then Role B inherits all privileges of Role A.
    - System roles already form a hierarchy: `ACCOUNTADMIN` > `SECURITYADMIN` > `USERADMIN` > `SYSADMIN` > `PUBLIC`.

---

## 4. Privileges

- **Definition**: Security privileges determine what actions can be performed on a securable object (e.g., `SELECT` on a table, `USAGE` on a warehouse).
- **Categories**:
    1. **Global Privileges**: e.g. `MANAGE GRANTS` (let you manage privileges on any object).
    2. **Account-Level Privileges**: e.g. `CREATE DATABASE`, `MONITOR USAGE`.
    3. **Schema-Level Privileges**: e.g. `USAGE` on a schema, `CREATE TABLE` in a schema.
    4. **Object-Level Privileges**: e.g. `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `MODIFY`, `TRUNCATE` on tables or views.

- **Granting & Revoking**
    - Use `GRANT <privilege> ON <object> TO ROLE <role_name>`.
    - Use `REVOKE <privilege> ON <object> FROM ROLE <role_name>`.
    - Only owners or roles with `MANAGE GRANTS` can grant/revoke.

- **Future Grants**
    - Automate privileges on objects *yet to be created*, e.g.
      ```sql
      GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA my_db.my_schema TO ROLE my_role;
      ```
    - Not supported with certain features (e.g. data sharing, replication, masking/row policies).

---

## 5. User Authentication

- **Username/Password** (default)
    - A user is created with `CREATE USER ... PASSWORD = '...'`.
    - Password must be ‚â•8 characters, at least 1 digit, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase.
    - Optionally set `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE` so user must reset on first login.
    - If no default role is specified, user inherits the `PUBLIC` role on login.

---

## 6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Overview**
    - Adds a second factor to the username+password login.
    - Snowflake uses Duo Security behind the scenes.
    - Enabled per *user* (via UI > Preferences > MFA).

- **Login Flow**
    1. User enters Snowflake username/password.
    2. Receives a DUO prompt (mobile push, phone call, or code).
    3. Approves or enters passcode to finalize login.

- **Admin Options**
    - **Bypass MFA**: Temporarily allow login without MFA (for X minutes).
    - **Disable MFA**: Cancels user‚Äôs enrollment; user must re-enroll if needed later.
    - **Allow Client MFA Caching**: Reduces repeated prompts for short successive logins.

---

## 7. Federated Authentication

- **Definition**: Delegates user authentication to an external **Identity Provider (IdP)** supporting **SAML 2.0**.
- **Supported IdPs**: Okta, ADFS, or custom SAML.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to log into multiple services (including Snowflake) with one set of IdP credentials.

- **Configuration**
    - Requires setting account properties like `SAML_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` (certificate, SSO URL, etc.).
    - An ‚ÄúSSO‚Äù button can appear on Snowflake‚Äôs login page, redirecting users to the IdP.

---

## 8. Key Pair Authentication, OAuth & SCIM

- **Key Pair Auth**
    - Replaces username/password with a *public/private key* pair.
    - Public key stored in Snowflake (`ALTER USER` to set `RSA_PUBLIC_KEY`).
    - Private key stays on client side, used by connectors (Python, Node, etc.) to authenticate.
    - Supports rotation with two concurrent keys.

- **OAuth 2.0**
    - **Delegated Authorization**: e.g. let a BI tool like Tableau access Snowflake without exposing user credentials.
    - Supported in two ways: Snowflake-hosted OAuth and External OAuth.

- **SCIM** (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)
    - Automates user provisioning and role assignments.
    - An IdP can push group updates into Snowflake via the SCIM API.

---

## 9. Network Policies

- **Purpose**: Restrict which IPs can connect to Snowflake, adding a layer of security beyond user credentials.
- **Creation**
  ```sql
  CREATE NETWORK POLICY my_policy
    ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24')
    BLOCKED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.10');
  ```
- **Application**
    - **Account-Level** (`ALTER ACCOUNT SET NETWORK_POLICY = my_policy;`)
    - **User-Level** (`ALTER USER username SET NETWORK_POLICY = my_policy;`)
    - Only one policy can be active per account/user.
    - If both are set, the user-level policy takes precedence.

---

## 10. Data Encryption

Snowflake handles **encryption at rest** and **in transit** automatically:

1. **Encryption at Rest**
    - **AES-256** on all table data, internal stages, result caches.
    - Uses a **hierarchical key model** (file keys < table keys < account key < Snowflake root key).
    - **Key Rotation** every 30 days, with an optional **periodic re-keying** that re-encrypts data (Enterprise edition feature).

2. **Encryption in Transit**
    - **TLS 1.2** over HTTPS for client connections (UI, JDBC, ODBC, etc.).
    - Ensures end-to-end encryption between the user and Snowflake.

3. **Tri-Secret Secure**
    - An optional approach to combine **Snowflake-managed key** + **customer-managed key**.
    - Customer can revoke their part of the key if needed.
    - Requires additional support and is only on Business Critical / higher editions.

---

## 11. Column-Level Security: Dynamic Data Masking

- **Masking Policies**
    - Schema-level objects specifying how to *dynamically mask* certain column data at query time.
    - Example policy:
      ```sql
      CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (
        val string
      ) RETURNS string ->
      CASE
        WHEN current_role() = 'SUPPORT' THEN val
        ELSE '****'
      END;
      ```
    - Attached to a column with:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE my_table
        MODIFY COLUMN email SET MASKING POLICY email_mask;
      ```
- **Behavior**
    - If a user‚Äôs role matches policy conditions, they see the *real* value; otherwise, they see a masked value.
    - Data is *not* modified on disk‚Äîmasking is *dynamic* at query time.

- **External Tokenization**
    - Store data in *tokenized* form, then *detokenize* with an external function if authorized by the masking policy.
    - Ensures even Snowflake cannot read the raw data unless the user is authorized and the external system decrypts.

---

## 12. Row-Level Security (Row Access Policies)

- **Definition**
    - Filter out entire rows from query results based on policy conditions.
    - Like masking policies but return *Boolean* conditions (whether to include the row).

- **Row Access Policy** Example
  ```sql
  CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY row_access_1 AS
  (val int) RETURNS boolean ->
  CASE
    WHEN current_role() = 'ADMIN' THEN true
    ELSE false
  END;
  ```
    - Applied via:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE my_table
        MODIFY COLUMN account_id SET ROW ACCESS POLICY row_access_1;
      ```
- **Behavior**
    - If the condition is false, the user never ‚Äúsees‚Äù those rows in query results.
    - Evaluated *before* any column masking policies.

---

## 13. Secure Views
- **Overview**
    - A **secure view** in Snowflake hides the underlying table metadata and logic from users who lack the necessary privileges.
    - It also disables certain query optimizations that could unintentionally expose restricted data.
    - You can designate both **standard views** and **materialized views** as secure by using the `SECURE` keyword during creation. 
      This allows you to protect both logical views and precomputed results.

    - Created with:
      ```sql
      CREATE SECURE VIEW my_view AS ...
      ```

      ### üîç **Example**
      Let‚Äôs say you have a sensitive table:
      
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE employee_data (
        id INT,
        name STRING,
        salary NUMBER,
        department STRING
      );
      ```
      
      You want to expose only names and departments to users without revealing salary info or the base table:
      
      ```sql
      CREATE SECURE VIEW public_view AS
      SELECT name, department
      FROM employee_data
      WHERE department = 'Finance';
      ```
      
      Now you can:
      ```sql
      GRANT SELECT ON VIEW public_view TO ROLE analyst;
      ```
      
      The `analyst` role can query the view but:
      - ‚ùå Cannot see or access the `employee_data` table
        - ‚ùå Cannot view the view‚Äôs SQL definition
        - ‚úÖ Can only see `name` and `department` for Finance employees


- **Effects**
    1. Definition & underlying object details are hidden from unauthorized users (even `SHOW VIEW` or `GET_DDL`).
    2. Prevents ‚Äúpush-down‚Äù optimizations that could accidentally reveal data that the user can‚Äôt normally access.

- **Tradeoff**
    - Potentially slower performance due to fewer optimizations.
    - Recommended only if you *must* mask table details from certain roles/users.

---

## 14. Account Usage & Information Schema

Snowflake provides built-in metadata views to support **auditing**, **monitoring**, and **usage analysis** across your account.

These are primarily exposed through two systems:
- The **SNOWFLAKE shared database**
- The **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** views available per database

### 14.1 SNOWFLAKE Database & ACCOUNT_USAGE

#### **SNOWFLAKE Database**
- A shared, **read-only database** (`SNOWFLAKE`) that includes multiple internal schemas for metadata tracking and billing analysis:

    - `ACCOUNT_USAGE` ‚Äî long-term, **account-level** metadata and activity tracking.
        - Includes details such as executed queries, login history, warehouse usage, table storage, user activity, and more.
        - Allows filtering by `user_name`, making it ideal for **auditing**, **security reviews**, and **technical troubleshooting**.
        - Data retention: up to **1 year**. Latency: around **2 hours**.

    - `ORGANIZATION_USAGE` ‚Äî **organization-wide** usage and billing metrics.
        - Aggregates credit usage and storage consumption across **all Snowflake accounts** in the same organization.
        - Does **not** expose per-user details ‚Äî only at the account level (`account_name`, `account_locator`).
        - Useful for **financial reporting**, **cost optimization**, and comparing environments (e.g., dev vs prod).

    - Other internal schemas:
        - `REPLICATION` ‚Äî metadata on **replication groups** and **failover configurations** (for high availability and DR).
        - `DATA_SHARING` ‚Äî tracks **inbound/outbound shares**, reader accounts, and usage of shared data.

- Typically, only the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role has access by default (but access can be granted to others).


#### **ACCOUNT_USAGE Schema**
- Contains views that provide **historical metadata and usage data**, such as:
    - Query history
    - Credit consumption
    - Role and user activity
    - Object DDL and access patterns
- Data is retained for **up to 1 year**
- Updates have a **~2-hour latency**
- Dropped objects are retained with a `DELETED` timestamp

    #### üîç Real-world usage difference

    - Want to know **who** used **how many credits** on **what warehouse** yesterday?  
    ‚Üí Use `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`

    - Want to know **how many total credits** your **QA account** spent last month?  
    ‚Üí Use `ORGANIZATION_USAGE.CREDITS_USED_BY_ACCOUNT_DAILY`

### 14.2 INFORMATION_SCHEMA

- **Definition**
    - A read-only schema **automatically created in every database**.
    - Contains views and table functions for metadata about objects in that **database** (some views provide info at the account level).

- **Usage & Retention**
    - Real-time or near real-time metadata, but with **shorter history** (typically from 7 days to 6 months, depending on the object type).
    - Does **not** track dropped objects.

- **Scope**
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` exists at the **database level**, not inside individual schemas.
    - It provides metadata for **all schemas and all objects** within that specific database (tables, views, procedures, privileges, etc.).

---

## 15. Conclusion & Next Steps

In **Section 3: Account Access & Security**, you learned about:

- **RBAC & DAC** (roles, privileges, object ownership)
- **User Authentication** (password policy, MFA, federated auth, key pairs, OAuth, SCIM)
- **Network Policies** (allow/block IP ranges)
- **Data Encryption** (hierarchical key model, tri-secret secure)
- **Column- and Row-Level Security** (masking, row access policies)
- **Secure Views** (hiding underlying table details)
- **Account Usage & Information Schema** (monitor usage, queries, objects)

This completes the fundamental security concepts essential for the SnowPro Core exam. In practice, combine these concepts to enforce *least privilege*, secure data in transit and at rest, and maintain strong governance over your Snowflake environment.
